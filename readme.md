### About this project
--------

***Python program*** is a project that was designed to work out of 
the box using PyPi from day one.  The creation of this started at 
a large codebase where the following languages are used to build 
programs C, C++, Dlang, Kotlin and Python.

The design of the project was meant for demonstrating a project
using the GitHub workflow super charged with continues integration.

However to make something that can defend agains hackers planting 
malicious software attacks or feed of data stored in your database
is mostly imposable and all that can be done is to mitigate the 
possibility of as many software attacks as posable.

- Setup with Codecov coverage.
- Simple project structure just for you. 
- Distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.
- Works 99.95% out of the box.
